Dataset
Bay Wheels is the first regional and large-scale bicycle sharing system deployed in California and on the West Coast of the United States. As of January 2018, the Bay Wheels system had over 2,600 bicycles in 262 stations across San Francisco, East Bay and San Jose.

On June 28, 2017, the system officially re-launched as Ford GoBike in a partnership with Ford Motor Company. After Motivate's acquisition by Lyft, the system was subsequently renamed to Bay Wheels in June 2019. The system is expected to expand to 7,000 bicycles around 540 stations in San Francisco, Oakland, Berkeley, Emeryville, and San Jose.

The dataset used for this exploratory analysis consists of Bay Wheels's trip data for individual rides made in a bike-sharing system covering the greater San Francisco Bay area from June 28, 2017 to December 31, 2017. The original dataset 2017-fordgobike-tripdata.csv can be found in the download here.

The Dataset consists of anonymized information regarding 519.700 bike trips, including its timing and geolocation of the start and end of each trip.
